# AI-Agents-Tutor-Interactive-Learning-Notebook
An interactive Jupyter Notebook designed to demonstrate how AI agents can be built and used for tutoring. The notebook walks through concepts step by step, covering Python-based implementations, learning workflows, and practical examples for applying AI in educational contexts.

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and run **AI-powered agents** for interactive tutoring using the [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework.  
The notebook (`ai_agents_tutor.ipynb`) walks through creating assistant and user proxy agents, configuring them with the OpenAI API, and simulating multi-agent conversations in a tutoring-style setup.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- How to set up the Autogen framework with the required dependencies.  
- How to configure and authenticate agents using the OpenAI API.  
- How to create **Assistant** and **User Proxy Agents**.  
- How to organize agents into a **Round-Robin Group Chat** so they interact by taking turns.  
- How AI agents can simulate **tutoring workflows**, reasoning, and responding in conversation.  

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- OpenAI API key  
- Autogen and its dependencies
